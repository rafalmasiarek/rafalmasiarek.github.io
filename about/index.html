<p>
<img src="/avatar.png" class="about-avatar" /> My name is Tyler Benziger. I am a web developer, father, and musician.
</p>

<p>
I work remotely for Adobe on <a href="http://spark.adobe.com">Adobe Spark</a>.
Previously, we were focused on validating and prototyping new ideas. The
flexibility of my team has given me some amazing opportunities including
working on projects like <a href="http://jquerymobile.com">jQuery Mobile</a>,
<a href="http://jquerymobile.com/themeroller">ThemeRoller</a>, and
<a href="http://adobe.com/muse">Muse</a>.
</p>

<p>
I have an amazing family, including my beautiful wife Amy, my
six-year-old son, Brody, and my five-year-old daughter, Grace.

I've been playing music for about 17 years. I dabble in a lot of different
instruments but my true love is the electric guitar. I've played with
some fellow musicians on a few different projects (mostly for fun), but
my heart is in worship. I am apart of music ministry at a church called
<a href="http://lifepointoakdale.org">LifePoint</a> in Oakdale, CA and it's
something about which I'm extremely passionate.

This is my blog where you'll find my rantings usually surrounding these
three topics.
